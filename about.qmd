## About Me

I am a Mathematics and Computer Science double major graduating in May 2023 from CSU Channel Islands. Upon graduation, I will continue working with an internet start-up company that I have been apart of for three years. I will move from intern level to a full-time software developer. Two years ago, I started the CSU Channel Islands Line Dance Club where I was the president sharing my love of line dancing. I taught line dances, organized events, and learned about leadership! I am currently learning how to fly airplanes in hopes of getting my private pilots license.
